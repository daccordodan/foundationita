# foundationita
A website withoud back-end (at the moment). Used nginx to put it online, so the references and links don't work without something else

This website was commissioned to me by an organization: it work on Discord and on some game's servers
So this is a very little presentation
It is created relatively fast and it has no back-end included

But maybe in the future...
